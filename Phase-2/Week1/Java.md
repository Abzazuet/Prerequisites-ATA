# JAVA

- The code we write is high level, called source code, and the compiler changes the source code to bytecode.
- A program must be compiled before objects can be created.

## Shapes

## Variables

- They usually have a default value.
- You can also initialize the variable when you declare it.

## Functions (methods)

- returnType name (parameters){statements}

```Java
int myFunction (int a, int b){
    int z = 2 * x - y;
    return z * x;
}
```

## Conditionals

- `if (condition){} else if(condition){} else{}`.

## Classes

- Groups data intop one logical unit.
- A template to make objects.
- private means that only code inside that same block can access that variable
- Declare a constructor by using public ClassName
- All functions are methods.
- main is the starting point.

## New

- Keyword used to create a new object.
- you create data in a heap and the data does not go away.
- this, points at the object is being used on.

## Methods

- Object.method(parameters)

## Types

- It specifies how an object should be interpreted.
- Not all numbers mean the same
- (int)x is called casting and it converts a datatype to another.
- 8 different primitive data types
- Each primitive has an object associated so you can call methods to it.

## For each
```JAVA
for (String line : f.lines()){
    System.out.println(line);
}
```
