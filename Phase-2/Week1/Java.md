# JAVA

- The code we write is high level, called source code, and the compiler changes the source code to bytecode.
- A program must be compiled before objects can be created.

## Shapes

## Variables

- They usually have a default value.
- You can also initialize the variable when you declare it.

## Functions (methods)

- returnType name (parameters){statements}

```Java
int myFunction (int a, int b){
    int z = 2 * x - y;
    return z * x;
}
```

## Conditionals

- `if (condition){} else if(condition){} else{}`.
