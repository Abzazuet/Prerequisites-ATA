# Sort
- Makes problem more efficient
- Easier to analyze

## Sort in place
- Sort the input without generating a different array
- Swap places with index

## Efficency
- Bubble and selection have same general shape, slow (n^2)
- Collections.sort is faster
- The interfaces allow us to call the defined functions with our own classes
- Comparable and comparator
- `Collections.sort` should always be used to sort
