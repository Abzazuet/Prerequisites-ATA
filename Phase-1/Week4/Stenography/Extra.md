# Stenography

- Hiding data in an image or other digital artifact.
- It requires more math than images.
- Needs to be done in decimal.
- Math.floor(num1/16);
- To get the least significant bytes you take the remainder (modulues).
- You want the most signficant bits from the image you wanna show and grab the most significant bits from the image you wanna hide. You'll put the bits from the image you wanna show first and the image you hide at last.
