# Programming
## Why?
- Programming would help us to look at all the pixels of our computer
- Image processing
## Everything is a number
- Computers only works with numbers.
- Can only do math.
- They do it really fast.
- Programs are numbers
## Abstraction
- Separation of the interface from the implementation.
- Ex. you can drive a car without knowing how it works.
- It has multiple layers.
## Strings
- Letters that are converted into numbers.
## Types
- The types tell what the number represents
## Images
- They are made up of pixels, which are numbers.
## Green Screen algorithm
1. Figure out how to do before we can program it.
2. Work in a smaller instance of the problem so we can do it by hand.
3. Write a step-by-step.
## Solving programming problems
* State Problem to solve
1. Work Example by hand
2. Write down what you did
3. Find patterns: algorithm for any instance (repetition, condition, values)
4. Check by hand: check with different inputs.
5. Translate to code: programming language
6. Run test cases
7. Debug failed test cases: use scientific method.
    
    * Algorithm problem would take us back to step 3.
    * Implementation problem would take us back to step 5.
