# Documentation

- Like a regular comment but start with /** instead of /*
- @ to describe characteristics like method parameters or return values
- After a class add /** to describe what it does
- @param describes parameters of a method, they go before the method
- @return describes the return value of a method
- @see to provide a link to a field or method
